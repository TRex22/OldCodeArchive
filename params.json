I have not included the actual past papers but they should not be too\r\ndifficult to find at respective high school websites or from teachers ect...\r\nThere are also my feeble attempts at the Computer Olimpiad in 2011 and 2012.\r\nSome of the work is from exercises I did in class - I tended not to to do exactly what was asked but\r\ndo my own thing.\r\n\r\n###Some More\r\nThe code here is not particularly good, but I would not like to loose it which is why I\r\nam making a git repo for it.\r\n\r\nThere may be more of my code out there somewhere but I dont think so. The really old code\r\nI wanted to keep was on a floppy disk which broke long ago and what I had managed to save was on a faulty disk.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
