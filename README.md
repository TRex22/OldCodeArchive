OldCodeArchive
==============

This is my old code archive. 
Here is where all my old code from when I was younger. 
This code is from the early 2000's

All Code is found in the Code folder.

I did use templates and samples for some of my early projects.
This code does have some embarassing stuff but it is old from when I was young.
Please dont judge

	\OldCode contains code From when I was 7 years old till about 14 I coded in Pascal, but the dates of these
files have been corrupted since the cd I stored them on was sort of badly written.

	\SchoolWork contains code I did in Highschool from 2010-2012
The school work folder has my attempts at old South African Past Papers and in some cases
my actual exam answers. I have not included the actual past papers but they should not be too
difficult to find at respective high school websites or from teachers ect...
There are also my feeble attempts at the Computer Olimpiad in 2011 and 2012.
Some of the work is from exercises I did in class - I tended not to to do exactly what was asked but
do my own thing.

	\CodeExperiments contains code experiments which I have done from 2009-2012/3
These are experimental code, tutorials or other strange things I have attempted to do.
Most of it is non functional and just stored here so I can get it off my Dropbox folder.

The code here is not particularly good, but I would not like to loose it which is why I
am making a git repo for it.

There may be more of my code out there somewhere but I dont think so. The really old code
I wanted to keep was on a floppy disk which broke long ago and what I had managed to save was on a faulty disk.
